This repository provides an interactive and practical guide to using **Chains in LangChain**, a foundational component for building complex, multi-step workflows with language models. It includes code examples, different chain architectures, and summarized notes for a comprehensive understanding.

## ðŸ§  Overview

Chains in LangChain allow developers to **combine multiple components**â€”such as prompts, LLM calls, and output parsersâ€”into structured sequences for handling more complex AI tasks. 

This project explores:

1. **SimpleChain** â€“ Basic linear execution using prompt and model.
2. **SequentialChain** â€“ Executes chains in a defined sequence, passing outputs along.
3. **ParallelChain** â€“ Runs multiple chains simultaneously and combines their outputs.
4. **ConditionalChain** â€“ Branches logic dynamically based on conditions.

For a structured summary, check out [**Notes Chains in Langchain.pdf**](https://github.com/Harsh-Jindal-web/Langchain-Chains/blob/main/Notes%20Chains%20in%20LangChain.pdf).
